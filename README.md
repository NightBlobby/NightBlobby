 <summary><h3>👾 My Villan Arc begins</h3></summary>

Hey there! I’m Blobby, your friendly neighborhood computer nerd. My journey into the world of tech began during the COVID-19 pandemic when I got my hands on an ancient relic—a dusty old system from 2004. It was supposed to be for online classes, but let’s be honest, I was more interested in everything else I could do with it.

### The Legend of the Unactivated Windows
Picture this: Windows 10, installed by none other than my dad, an IT student himself. But wait, what's that in the bottom right corner of my screen? A watermark taunting me, "Activate Windows." Being the curious (and slightly rebellious) soul that I am, I quickly figured out how to activate Windows for free. Am I confessing to a crime here? Maybe! 😅 But hey, they say curiosity killed the cat, right? Well, in my case, it just made me fall in love with tech even more.

### From Booting Up to Blowing Minds
That’s when the floodgates opened. I dove headfirst into coding, graphic design, game development, animations, server management, and AI creation. If it has a screen, a CPU, or can be coded, I’m probably obsessed with it. My GitHub is the playground where all these passions come to life—whether it’s building AI that can create ringtones synced with LED lights, crafting custom assistants that could probably pass for a sci-fi movie character, or working on side projects that sometimes turn into all-nighters.

### Projects That Define Me
- **NEURAL INTERACTIVE RESPONSIVE AGENT (N.I.R.A)**: This is my pride and joy, an AI assistant designed to make life easier, handle daily tasks, and most importantly, ensure your data stays private. Also, it might Rickroll you every now and then—consider yourself warned.
- **Glyph Magic**: Working with the Nothing Phone’s Glyph system, syncing lights to ringtones because who doesn’t want a disco on their phone?
- **Game Dev & Animations**: From pixel art to 3D models, I’ve dabbled in it all. Still waiting for Pixar to call though.

### Some Nerdy Jokes (Because Why Not?)
- Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because the light attracts bugs.
- I would tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it. 
- Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack.

### The Future?
Who knows? I’m constantly learning and evolving. Whether it's mastering AI, creating the next viral game, or figuring out how to avoid getting jailed for that Windows activation thing (kidding… probably), I’m always up for a challenge. Tho i'm lazy so i dont know...

So, welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to browse around, check out my projects, and maybe even collaborate on something cool. Just don’t ask me to fix your printer—seriously, they have a mind of their own.
